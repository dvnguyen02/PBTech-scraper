ASUS RT-AX52 (AX1800) Dual-Band WiFi 6 Extendable Router,1x Gigabit WAN Port - 4x Gigabit LAN Ports,129,"BSS Coloring Boosts Connection Efficiency
WiFi 6 includes a new feature called BSS Coloring that improves WiFi connection efficiency even in crowded environments. When two neighboring routers send traffic on the same channel, your router has to wait until the channel is free. With BSS Coloring, your WiFi 6 router identifies its data with a unique channel tag ('color') that's different from neighboring networks. Your WiFi 6 router can then ignore other-colored signals on the channel and send data immediately.* This greatly reduces router waiting times and boosts network efficiency.
The Latest WPA3 Network Security
The next generation of WiFi security, bringing new capabilities to enhance WiFi protections in personal networks. Building on the widespread adoption of WPA2 over more than a decade, WPA3 adds new features to simplify WiFi security, enable more robust authentication, and deliver increased cryptographic strength for highly sensitive data markets."
