When two neighboring routers send traffic on the same channel, your router has to wait until the channel is free. With BSS Coloring, your WiFi 6 router identifies its data with a unique channel tag ('color') that's different from neighboring networks. Your WiFi 6 router can then ignore other-colored signals on the channel and send data immediately.* This greatly reduces router waiting times and boosts network efficiency.\nThe Latest WPA3 Network Security\nThe next generation of WiFi security, bringing new capabilities to enhance WiFi protections in personal networks.
