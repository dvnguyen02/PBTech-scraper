conversation - handy if you want to keep your headphones on, or your hands are full.\nOptimising Noise Cancelling\nTo maximise noise cancelling performance, the WH-1000XM4 headphones incorporate two technologies: Personal Noise Cancelling Optimiser, designed specifically for you, and Atmospheric Pressure Optimising, designed specifically for air travel.\nMultipoint Connection\nFor total convenience, WH-1000XM4 headphones can be paired with two Bluetooth devices at the same time. So when a call comes in, your headphones know which device is ringing and connect to the right one automatically. You'll also be able to quickly, smoothly switch your headphones to either of the two devices at the touch of a button.","2":"","3":"HD 450BT\nStep up to great wireless sound with the new HD 450BT.

Surpassing conventional soft-iron, single magnet designs, the NEXT audiophile headphone employ a patented Ironless motor assembly paired with a proprietary magnesium diaphragm for an emotional listening experience. 6061-T6 aluminum was chosen for its light weight, high-strength, and workability, in this case resulting in an eye-catching design that's equally as comfortable.The open-back design provides two immediate benefits: natural, spacious, sound reproduction devoid of coloration, and improved transient response-the headphone's ability to respond to sudden changes within the waveform.
